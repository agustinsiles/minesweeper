# Minesweeper

This is a test for a minesweeper developed with Angular 7.

## Try it locally
Once you've cloned or downloaded this repo, run `npm i` in the root directory. Then, run `ng serve --open` to build the app and your default browser will automatically pop up with the app running in port 4200. If you want to switch to a different port, simply modify the `package.json` and modify the `start` script with `"start": "ng serve --port=3000"` -where 3000 is the port you want to use.

## TODOs
- Improve some performance
- Allow multi user
- Allow storage and persistance.
